5,40,D,75,I place the majority of the blame on the defendant's shoulders  because\, as a motorist\, it is his responsibility to be more vigilant and aware of his environment. This responsibility is his as he is the one wielding more power as a driver in comparison to the lesser power of a cyclist. Mr. Johnson's negligence may kill another as opposed to Mr. Woodward's negligence mostly only leaving himself at risk.\
,30
6,52,D,87,the cyclist did everything wrong: he tried to beat the light\, he wore earbuds   \
,71
7,45,P,37,I found that the plaintiff was distracted by his phone and did not see the cyclist and therefore crashed with the cyclist. I found that the cyclist was distracted by the earphone and did not hear the car coming in the intersection and did not have adequate time to stop\, which caused the cyclist to collide with the car entering the intersection. \
,69
8,49,D,40,the cyclist was distracted and still tried to get the light. it was probably already on don't walk.  \
,60
9,47,D,70,Mostly ignoring flashing light by bicyclist. Also he was on the phone with earbuds and distracted by a dog.\
The driver was too fast\, but stopped and didn't text or did a call.  \
,80
10,53,P,52,  \
It seems as if they were both at fault.\
\
\
\
\
\
,50
11,50,P,60,It seems to be the case that both parties did something wrong. However\, the stipulation that once the do not walk sign is flashing\, one should not enter an intersection\, seems to be the binding law against the cyclist.  If that weren't the case\, I think it would be squarely on the driver.  In fact it may be the case that were he not speeding\, he would have had time to stop. \
,60
12,42,D,91,it seems that the time line of the bell tower and the and the changing of the lights is in line with what the defendant said about the light being green. If the accident occurred within the 30 seconds after the the bell started at noon\, the light must have switched to green for the motorist and the light for the cyclist must have already been a solid don't walk. Also if the dog was distracting to the cyclist he must have seen the dog in the car behind the car that hit him\, this must be true because the bell tower it too loud to hear the dog. Also the witness who stopped to help the cyclist almost rear ended the motorist so she must have also been moving because they had a green light. Because of the time line created by the witnesses and the facts about the lights and bell tower the cyclist must have played a role in the accident by not stopping when the light changed. \
,60
13,51,D,60,Due to Mr. Woodward seeing the flashing don't walk sign and continuing into the intersection anyway indicates him to be more at fault for the accident. However\, the defendant was speeding before the accident which means that he was not abiding by street laws.\
  \
,35
14,46,D,84,Mr. Woodward the cyclist stated that he entered the intersection while the light was flashing do not walk which is against the law. This indicates negligence.  \
,72
15,43,D,65,Given the witness' (Ms. Johnson) testimony regarding her near collision with the defendant (Mr. Johnson) due to his abrupt stop. One can assume that since she was traveling in the same direction on the same road it seems unlikely they both would have attempted to run a red light at the same time\, and that they were traveling through the intersection at a green light. Given that the law does not permit cyclist to enter the cross walk as the signal is flashing the plaintiff should not have been in the cross walk and is therefore at fault. However given the defendants excessive speed he also shares fault for the severity of the injuries.\
,60
16,48,P,44,The car driver receive a text and was not attending the traffic.,77
17,41,D,56,The two were both negligent\, but Woodward was more negligent than Johnson because Woodward tried to beat the light and he was talking on his cellphone-- even though he one ear free.  Johnson\, on the other hand\, called his wife\, but was not texting on his phone\, even though he took off quickly after the light changed.\
  \
,41
18,54,D,70,The most important piece of evidence to me was that the Woodward entered the intersection when the dont walk signal was flashing and you are not supposed to enter the intersection at that time. also he was talking on the phone so it may have stopped flashing even right when he entered the intersection and he may have been distracted. \
  \
,70
19,44,P,69,Due to the the cyclist being on a phone call\, despite his assertions that he was not distracted and was use to riding while talking on the phone\, was distracted.  It makes it more likely that the light had just turned green and the cyclist was in the intersection when he should not have been.  The driver is still at fault for excessive speed. ,60
20,60,D,70,Mr. Woodward was speaking on his phone and distracted by a dog in the SUV. Mr Johnston did not seem to be on his phone from the phone records and although he may have been speeding\, he seemed to be following the other driving regulations.   \
,52
21,59,D,70,  The phone records and other driver's statement leads us to believe that Johnson was using a cell phone during the time of the collision. The fact that he dropped it in the car (instead of having it in his pocket) may be further proof of this. The skid marks on the road\, testimony by the officer\, and damage to the car also lead us to believe he was speeding during the time of the collision.\
\
,25
22,57,D,95,Although the resulting injury from the accident was to the cyclist\, both parties have proven fault in the accident. Through analysis of skid marks at the scene\, there is a strong suggestion that Mr. Johnson was speeding at the time of the accident. Mr. Johnson should have followed normal vehicular safety protocol and looked both ways before proceeding into the intersection. However Mr. Woodward did not abide by the rules clearly posted on the traffic post\, "DO NOT START IF THE HAND IS FLASHING" where Mr. Woodward ignored these rules and began to cross regardless. It is unclear whether he had headphones in both ears or not\, which would be illegal. Due to the distracted driving AND cycling\, both parties have equal fault. \
,50
23,61,D,80,The cyclist should have looked up before crossing the street. The defendant was not on his phone at the time of the accident.\
\
,70
24,58,D,57,The plaintiff entered the intersection against a flashing DON'T WALK signal\, was on a conference call with an ear bud in one ear\, and was distracted by a dog.\
  \
,75
25,62,D,50,Evidence suggests that although Mr. Johnson may have have been using his phone at or around the time of the crash\, Mr. Woodward was behaving equally negligent by entering the crosswalk when he shouldn't have and he was distracted by being on his phone as well.  \
,60
26,0,P,23,asdfasdf  \
,30
27,65,P,100,I believe that the motorist was lying about being on his cell phone. I believe it is the motorist's responsibility to not be distracted while driving. Motor vehicles are lethal weapons and need to be driven with the utmost care and caution.  \
,40
28,68,P,88,I said the accident was mostly Mr. Woodward's fault because he was on the phone on a conference call\, and even though he said it wasn't that distracting because he was used to doing this. Work is usually distracting and talking to someone during  a conference should be important and should take some thinking and distraction. It had to have been that important that it could not wait until he was done riding his bike. Also i didn't see any real evidence of weather or not the  stoplight was green red or yellow for the driver. \
\
\
,65
29,70,D,33,Woodward shouldn't have entered the crosswalk at the time of the flashing signal. Driver shouldn't have been speeding. \
\
,61
30,72,P,88,Mr. Woodward had been talking on the phone with headphones in while entering the intersection as the "Don't Walk" screen was flashing. Clearly there is instructions that say do not start the intersection as that light is flashing. If he would have his headphones off and paid full attention he would have seen the light turn green. Mr. Johnson is not at fault for the accident because the light had turn green for his vehicle to go. He did not see Mr. Woodward still crossing the intersection in time in order to avoid the collusion but he did attempt to stop in order to avoid it. \
,70
31,71,D,70,Mr. Woodward was wearing headphones and did not justify that he was only wearing one headphone. He also entered the intersection while the crosswalk sign was blinking. He shouldn't have entered the crosswalk. \
   \
,60
32,74,D,70,The plaintiff should have never entered the the intersection with a blinking walk signal\, nor do I feel he should be on his phone. He has the responsibility for his own safety. The driver however should also not be on his phone and should always look before entering an intersection\, I think he probably had the right of way\, because of the driver behind him almost hitting him and that plaintiff stating the cross signal was blinking. This is an accident\, they happen and no charges should be placed on either party.    \
,60
33,67,D,90,Mr. Woordward's disposition at the time made him feel like he needed to beat the light and we know this because Mr. Woodward admitted that the crosswalk sign was flashing. The flashing sign means he should not have crossed.\
\
Mr. Johnson may have been reading text\, since he received a text within two minutes of the accident.However\, since the light switches every 1 minute\, if he read the text when he received it and it took him under 1 minute 50 seconds to read the text\, (assuming the crosswalk turns solid 10 seconds before the light turns green) he was not texting when he entered the intersection. While we do have Mrs. Jones's testimony that she witnessed Mr.Johnson texting\, I believe that if Mr. Johnson noticed that the light changed to green before he had time to come to a full stop\, he was aware of his surroundings at the time and was NOT negligent seconds before the collision. \
\
\
Mr. Johnson was also speeding as indicated by Sergeant Morgan. Since Mrs.Jones followed him into the intersection\, we can infer that the light was indeed green for those travelling East on S Golden Rd. In addition\, if Mrs. Jones almost rear-ended Mr. Johnson when he applied the brakes\, it means that she was too close to him to come to full and safe stop. As such\, if we believe that Sergeant Morgan's statement that Mr.Johnson was speeding\, then it is safe to assume that Mrs.Jones was speeding as well. Then the credibility and reliability of Mrs.Jones comes into question and it becomes harder to believe her statement that Mr.Johnson was texting.\
\
Since proof that the light was definitively red and that Mr.Johnson was reading his text message when he received it\, I believe the plaintiff wasn't able to meet their burden of proof.  \
\
,65
34,69,D,90,Mr Woodward should not have entered the cross walk with a flashing walk sign and Mr Johnson Should not have been speeding. Mr. Woodward was lying about talking to Canada so I expect he was lying about having both ear buds in as well.    \
,75
35,75,D,90,I believe that both parties were responsible for the accident. Mr Johnson should not have been driving so fast and should slow down going through the intersection\, knowing that the light had barely turned green. Mr. Johnson only had 2 texts on his phone bill\, the one that day was incoming\, so it seemed to me that he was not texting while driving. Mr Woodward had head phones in his ears which were illegal. His phone call ended before the crash\, so i am unsure to why he still had his headphones in his ears. Mr. Woodward also rode into the intersection when he was no longer supposed to\, knowing that there could be consequences. He stated he was trying to beat the light. I feel that Mr. Woodward was also distracted and may have not seen the Mr. Johnson's car because there was a dog in an SUV and a large truck still stopped at the intersection. If Mr. Woodward had followed the do not cross sign\, he would not have been injured. This is why I believe he is partially at fault for his injuries.   \
,60
36,66,D,70,Mr. Woodward was more negligent than Mr. Johnson in his actions. Mr. Woodward had both earplugs in at the time of the collision when law clearly states that having earphones in/over both ears is against the law. Even though Mr. Woodward was aware that the walk sign was flashing red\, he disregarded the signal and continued to enter the intersection in hopes of "beating the light" according to the officer. The walk signal directions state that a pedestrian is not to begin crossing an intersection\, only finish crossing\, when the walk signal is flashing red: This applies to bicyclists as well.\
\
It is not entirely clear whether Mr. Johnson was on his phone at the time of the collision\, although there was a single witness that reported him being on a phone at the time. There is no concrete evidence to prove that he was actually on the phone at the time. The skid marks as described by the officer may have been an indication of an abrupt stop\, as Johnson did see the cyclist immediately prior to colliding with him I believe that this is not reason enough to declare Mr. Johnson at fault\, as the evidence is clear that Mr. Woodward disregarded multiple laws at his own risk of injury.   ,60
37,73,D,0,Each was at fault due to negligence; both were using their phones in traffic.  \
,50
38,76,D,84,I feel like the cyclist was more at fault because he had more distractions and was not as focused as the driver who seemed to make a more honest mistake rather than just being distracted and not caring.   \
,72
39,77,D,85,As much as your supposed to share the road\, byeciclists should know to pay attention on the road. Don't have a telephone call when riding through traffic. Maybe use the bike lane as well. As for johnson\, don't text while driving. I also doubt that johnson would excelerate when he did not have a green light.\
 \
,69
40,78,D,91,when the flashing hand goes off\, you are not suppose to cross the intersection. if you are already crossing you have the right to finish. But the cyclist decided to go trying to beat the light. the car had the green and was proceeding but had to stop suddenly when the cyclist crossed his path. \
  \
,75
41,79,D,85,Even though the Plaintiff Mr. Woodward entered the intersection while the "Do not walk" sign was flashing\, and even though he was talking on his phone with headphones\, the motorist\, Mr. Johnson\, as a responsible motorist\, must have come to a complete stop before the light had turned green so that there would have been a wider time gap before he started driving again after the light turned green. In other words he must have allowed more time between slowing down\, stopping and moving. Also\, it has been proven that his speed might have been exceeding the speed limit\, as well as the fact that he might have been on his phone during the drive. \
,40
42,84,D,80,I came to my decision based on the fact that the bicyclist\, Mr. Woodward had earplugs on and was taking a conference call while he was riding a bicycle. Just like laws that permit motorists from talking on their phones and texting\, a bicyclists needs to be aware of their surrounding and not be distracted by a conversation\, even more so if they are occupied with controlling a vehicle that will go into traffic. Though there is the idea of Mr. Johnson going over the speed limit\, I feel like the blame is more on Mr. Woodward in this specific situation.   \
,60
43,80,P,70,Cell phones are quite distracting so it is possible that Mr. Woodward thought he saw the flashing do not walk signal but in actuality it could have been a solid do not walk signal. The law states that a cyclists should NOT enter the intersection if that signal is flashing or solid\, so either way that was negligence on Mr. Woodward's side. Mrs. Jones testimony also seemed to corroborate with Mr. Johnson's story of the light turning green because she had to slam on her breaks to avoid hitting him. Suggesting the light really was green so she and Mr. Johnson were following traffic laws and proceeding through the intersection. The truck that was still "stopped" at the intersection according to Mr. Woodward was most likely slow going or Mr. Woodward was unaware of the truck's movement while biking.   \
,70
44,81,D,80,Mr. Woodward was mostly at fault for the accident because he was on the phone with ear buds in his ears. In addition\, he also showed that he was distracted while coming up on the intersection by saying he noticed the dog. Mr. Woodward violated the crosswalk law by beginning to enter the cross walk after the flashing hand had already started. The crosswalk law states you can only finish crossing in the cross walk if you had already begun before the flashing hand flashes. Mr. Johnson was only partially at fault because he was speeding at the time of the accident.  \
,80
45,83,D,74,The light was in the drivers favor\, the cyclist totally disregarded the crosswalk and entered too late\, and wasn't being mindful of traffic\
,84
46,82,P,80,  \
Mr. Woodward should have not been talking on the phone however he does it so often that he can multitask. Mr. johnson should have not been speeding.\
,67
47,87,D,87,The plaintiff was on the phone and was not fully aware of his surroundings. Mr.Johnson although most likely distracted was speeding but saw the cyclist in time where as the cyclist never even heard Mr. Johnson coming.\
  \
,57
48,88,D,75,although the crosswalk was not on thee solid 'dont walk' screen\, it was flashing and the cyclist should not have entered the intersection at that time to try and "beat the light"\, he should have waited for the next light. the driver may or may not have been texting\, however we cannot be certain and cannot hold him accountable.\
\
,56
49,86,P,27,Cyclist laced of the ability of expectation.\
  \
,74
50,85,D,90,  It seems that Mr. Johnson may have been on his phone but was still able to acknowledge the rules of the road and was aware enough of his surrounding to be able to tell that the traffic light had changed from red to green and was even able to starting slowing down once he saw Mr. Woodward. However\, Mr.Woodward had been attempted to cycle through the intersection even after the crossing sign had clearly warned him otherwise. Mr. Woodward went through the intersection without looking to see if any cars were coming in the direction but only noticed the stopped car on the opposite of the street. He was also distracted by his ear phones in while talking on the phone. Ergo\, Mr. Woodward should have been paying a little bit more attention to his surroundings.\
 ,85
51,90,P,63,I believe that Mr. Johnson is more at fault due to the fact that he lied about having a smartphone\, and even said he didn't know how to use text. He was also seen texting and driving\, which is illegal.   \
,30
52,89,D,80,  \
I believe the cyclist is more at fault because of a couple reasons.  One\, he admitted to being distracted by the dog.  Two\, he entered the intersection on the flashing hand signal\, which legally indicates that you need to wait to cross\, and to only finish crossing if you have already started.  ,80
53,92,D,81,He was texting and speeding. More illegal than on a bike and on a hands free device.\
  \
\
,25
54,93,D,36,I believe that if Mr. Johnson was not distracted and/or speeding\, he may have been able to stop and see the bicyclist in time before the collision.  \
,56
55,98,P,86,  I believe that as a motorist\, the driver wasn't responsible therefore it is his fault. Yes the cyclist sped off and shouldn't of tried to beat the intersection but the driver clearly lied about being on the phone\, guilty. ,25
56,94,P,80,I believe that both parties were at fault due to negligence. Although I believe that if the motorist had come to a complete stop at the light instead of slowing down then starting to go once the light was green that the accident could have been avoided. If the motorist had stopped completely he would have had time to completely check the intersection before proceeding. I also believe that the use of a cell phone by the motorist would have been distracting causing him to be less aware. Although\, the cyclist was not properly following the laws of pedestrians\, which played a factor in the accident\
  \
,45
57,99,D,100,I believe that Mr. Woodward holds the majority of the fault due to negligence as it is clearly stated that when the crosswalk sign is flashing\, a person should not enter the crosswalk. By his own admission\, Mr. Woodward clearly saw that the crosswalk sign was not signaling him to enter the intersection\, and regardless of his own confidence he should not have done so. That being said\, regardless of confidence in ones own speed\, it is considered negligent to enter an intersection without looking both ways to check for other vehicles\, which shows me that the phone call Mr. Woodward was engaged in was a negligent distraction. Mr. Johnson\, however\, does hold a small portion of the blame due to the assumed speed negligence. It is also clear to me that Mr. Johnson had the green light\, due to the fact that the witness in the SUV behind him almost rear-ended him when he slammed on his breaks. If Mr. Johnson had had the red light\, that incident would not have happened as the witness would have been slowing down or stopped. Therefore\, entering an intersection on a green light is not considered negligence and is not cause for Mr. Woodward's injuries.\
,80
58,100,P,52,The bicyclist had ear phones in his ears and was distracted. He also crossed the crosswalk when the sign was telling him not to. Even though this was the case\, the driver Mr Johnson is also partly responsible because he seemed to be distracted as well and was driving too fast which prevented him from stopping in time.  \
,57
59,101,P,75,The cyclist is not guilty because the evidence showed that the driver was speeding and possibly trying to beat the yellow light which is why he did not see the cyclist; he was too focused on staring at the light.  The cyclist was being negligent\, however the driver was more at fault.  \
,30
60,97,D,60,Mr Woodward entered a crosswalk while it was flashing 'Don't Walk\,' which means don't enter but you can finish. That at least puts some blame on him for his injury. The lights change every minute but I didn't use that info well enough in the graph. It was hard to determine when the 'WALK' Changed to flashing 'DONT WALK' Also the defendant had some data usage on his phone indicating some internet capabilities\, but he did say "I don't really use my phone." Not "I don't have it." Defendant should have been slowing BEFORE the red light not as it was ending\, plus he was speeding.\
\
,60
61,103,D,86,Mr. Woodward was using ear buds while riding a bicycle\, it is assumed that they were both earbuds\, as it was never stated that he only had one. It is against traffic law to enter an intersection when the "do not walk" sign is flashing. Mr. Woodward stated that the sign was flashing when he entered the intersection\, he said he thought he had plenty of time. \
  \
,90
62,105,P,80,The information given by each person involved seems to fall with Mr. Woodward. If he entered the cross walk while the stop hand was flashing then Mr. Johnson's light should have still been red. \
,20
63,96,D,60,I feel like both party's had negligence\, however it is up to drivers not to use phones whatsoever in a vehicle when driving because it hinders your reaction time. i will not solo blame the driver to blame\, since both party's had use their phone and should not use their phones\, but one of them is driving a car which requires a lot more attention since one move can kill somebody\, even if they are not doing anything distracting. If it was only\, the cyclist using the phone\, then full responsibility will be placed on the cyclist instead and the opposing party as well.\
,45
64,95,D,80,The cyclist was on his phone with headphones in\, which is distracting and illegal. If the lights are set at intervals of one minute between when the "don't walk" signal is lit and the light turns green\, then it seems as though Mr. Woodward entered the intersection when he was not supposed to.\
,69
65,106,P,60,Phone records prove that Mr. Johnson received a phone call and text\, as well as made a phone car while driving. Although he did not send a text\, this is still a distraction.\
The cyclist was on the phone as well\, however evidence proves that this is not a distraction for the cyclist. The fact that his phone call was over 15 minutes long before the collision occurred shows that he knows what he is doing; especially as a triathlon member. \
Ultimately\, the reason that I find Mr. Johnson guilty is that the crosswalk sign was a flashing "Do not walk" sign when the cyclist entered\, which was wrong by his part\, HOWEVER\, lets just say another pedestrian\, on foot\, crossed the crosswalk when they had the okay to go. If they were still walking across the crosswalk when the flashing "Do not walk" sign was occurring\, which is 100% legal and right by behalf of the pedestrian\, then Mr. Johnson still would have been entering the intersection and would have hit a walking pedestrian.,40
66,104,P,70,The main reason I sided with the cyclist is\, in my view\, the driver seemed to have lied about knowing how to text. And\, as Mrs. Jones stated\, that he was distracted at looking at his phone right before the collision occurred. Both were at fault since neither were paying good attention\, but I found it more dangerous for the motorist to be distracted by looking at his phone than the cyclist talking on his phone with one ear bud in.   \
,39
67,102,P,86,even though Mr Woodward was on a call and says he was distracted by the dog\, Mr Johnson received a call\, received a text\, placed a call and his claims to Officer Morgan were not true once the phone records were produced; Mr Woodward was straight forward with Officer Morgan and admitted that he was in fact on a conference call. The other evidence I felt substantiates Mr Woodward's case is that drivers must look at the intersection and not just drive when the light turns red.   \
,22
68,107,D,100, Evidence does not indicate which of the both individuals was at fault\, the evidence shows that both individuals were distracted\, one on the phone in a conference call\, the other possibly texting. Records show that he had only texted two messages\, proving that his statement was true when he indicated not texting much. I believe that the officers should have asked Mrs. Jones if the light was green or red\, she was following Mr. Johnson for a few blocks\, therefore she should have known if it was their turn to drive through the intersection or not. \
,50
69,109,P,56,Mr. Woodward was distracted on a call when he was hit by Mr. Johnson. He went out into the intersection when the crosswalk was already flashing and you're not suppose to enter. He sped across thinking that he could make the light in time and was hit.\
\
,60
70,108,D,80,The cyclist 1) entered the crosswalk on a flashing "Don't Walk" signal and 2) was talking on the phone while biking. He was distracted at the time of the accident. Mr. Johnson was rightful in slowing down to an upcoming red light\, and though may have been speeding\, was legally entering the intersection at the right time. \
,75
71,110,D,60, Even though pedestrians in most cases have the right away\, the plaintiff was negligent in that he was on his cell phone and purposefully rode into a flashing intersection.\
,70
72,113,D,55,Drivers need to be weary of the road. With a car comes great responsibility. Same with cyclists; however\, Mr. Woodward seemed to be more reasonable\, in this case.\
  \
,38
73,111,D,100,The Plantiff was not following the law\, as he wore both headphones while cycling and crossed the intersection when the sign flashed DON'T WALK. The Defendant was abiding traffic light laws and there is no reliable and for sure evidence that he was on his phone during the collision\, only the witness "thought" he was on his phone. The records don't show that he was actively talking or texting. The Defendent should be cited for speeding though. \
,90
74,112,D,99,I don't remember everything exactly but depending on when the 9/11 call was made (because it should be the closest account for when the collision happened. Every evidence pointed to 12:00 PM but i don't remember all of the evidence exactly\, but both parties were at negligence and should have paid more attention. The driver should not speed and the bicyclist should not cross when its not safe.\
\
,50
75,117,P,53,I think the cyclist should be aware that his phone conversation distracted him from being aware of the crossing signs\, and he shouldn't have tried to speed through the crosswalk.  \
,67
76,116,D,80,The cyclist should not have gone when the light for him was not green.The driver was probably looking at his phone because he thought he was getting a red light.Also Mr Woodward should not have gone because the truck that he thought was going on a green was probably going on a yellow.  \
,51
77,114,D,90,The plaintiff cannot prove that the motorist was distracted by his cell phone\, however the plaintiff did have both ear buds in his ear with riding his bike. \
\
   \
,40
78,115,P,70,The case was tricky\, but with the evidence of speeding\, the witness account of talking on the phone\, and the right of way for pedestrians/bicyclists\, I believe that the driver was being more reckless than the biker by a small margin. \
\
,40
79,121,P,95,Woodward tried to beat the light and cross the intersection as well as talking on the phone however\, Johnson was speeding and distracted by a text he received. Talking on the phone is the same level of distraction the bicyclist would receive from the bell tower  \
 \
,29
80,119,P,81,The reason as to why I decided that Mr. Johnson was guilty is because even though his light was green\, he is still responsible for stopping and checking to see if the crosswalk sign is on OR if there are pedestrian's walking. The law states that Pedestrian's do have the right of way and thus I was persuaded enough that he just was not following traffic laws. With that said\, both parties are still responsible for being aware of their surroundings.   \
,50
81,125,D,70,  Mr. Woodward had headphones on\, and knew that he couldn't cross because of the flash hand told him to stop. Mr. Johnson made a stop on the red light\, and when he saw it was green he went for it. Mr. Woodward knew when to go and when not go\, but he still went.\
,80
82,124,D,99,From the phone records it seems as though Mr. Johnson was on his phone prior to the collision which was a distraction. The officer took note of the marks Mr.Johnson's car left at the scene and he was possibly speeding as well. While driving one must be observant of everything around them especially while driving through intersections. Mr. Woodworth was also at fault for having both ear buds in his ears and on the phone while on his bike.\

83,129,P,100,Yes the plaintiff Mr. Woodward was at some fault for entering the crosswalk when the signal indicated otherwise\, but with a witness testifying that Mr. Woordward was on the phone as well as Officer Morgan indicating he was speeding by the skid marks i see negligence falling on the defendant. It's more on the driver of the vehicle considering the damage that can be caused and a driver must also scan any intersection before entering to avoid cases such as these.  \
,35
84,128,D,100,Without a witness to exactly who entered the intersection negligently they are both equally at fault. The plaintiff had to have entered the intersection under either a flashing or solid do not cross sign if the opposite traffic signal switched from red to green while he remained in the cross walk. Mr. Johnson was determined to have been speeding and was appropriately cited for the his mistake. \

85,118,D,47,The cyclist entered the crosswalk when he wasn't supposed to and was distracted from being on the phone and by a dog\, and the driver was seen sending texts while he was driving and was said to be speeding.  \
\
\
\
,46
86,126,D,80,If both parties were being honest\, it could be suggested that it was an honest accident. However\, pedestrians have the right a way. Mr. Johnson should have been more cautious before crossing the into the intersection.  \
,55
87,120,D,70,Cyclist should not have entered into the crosswalk after it began flashing\, but motorist may have been speeding through intersection.,67
88,123,P,75,Both parties were partly to blame for the accident. The cyclist should not have tried to cross the intersection when the Dont Walk sign was flashing. However\, Mr. Johnson should not have been on his phone and he should not have been speeding.\
  \
,40
89,122,D,85,I feel that Woodward was more responsible for his actions due to the fact that he knowingly decided to dart across the intersection when the hand was still flashing. Law according to this simulation states that when the crossing hand signal is flashing\, the individuals who are in the cross walk at the moment should finish and those who haven't been in yet should not proceed. This make him negligible of his actions. With this being said if the defendant wasn't speeding or would have made a complete stop at the light\, he would have been able to stop or properly avoid Mr. Woodward.  \
\
\
\
,60
90,127,D,30,I found the defendant as being less guilty because of the side information that was relevant to the case. If the "Don't Walk" signal was blinking prior to Mr. Woodward actually being the intersection\, then he shouldn't have entered in the first place. Mr. Woodward was also wearing headphones and was not fully paying attention to what was ahead.   \
,40
91,133,D,90,It was clear to me that the motorist was on the phone while driving and he was in fact speeding. If he was going the speed limit he would have been able to break easily.   \
,30
92,137,P,86,I feel that both the plaintiff and the defendant were at least partially at fault because they both broke laws stating that their attention was compromised. one being that the bicyclist was wearing headphones and talking on the phone while entering the crosswalk at a later than safe time\, and the second being that the driver was speeding\, possibly talking on the phone and not acting safely in order to stop when necessary. I feel that the officer acted justly by issuing them both citations for this case.\
,45
93,132,D,45,  \
I believe that both parties were some what to blame for this event.  I believe that there is no solid evidence saying which one was at fault.  I do believe that both parties were not being cautious enough and should have both been more careful.,51
94,131,D,93,I do not believe there was enough evidence to support the decision that the motorist was at fault. There was more concrete evidence surrounding the cyclist.   \
,10
95,134,D,70,By the defendant's statement\, he entered into the crosswalk while the do not walk was flashing. According to the plaintiff's phone record\, he was on the phone at the time of the collision. Because both were negligent\, I render that 50% was plaintiff's fault and 50% was defendants' fault. There was not any overwhelming evidence on either side to prove that one was at fault more than the other. Both witnesses did not see the accident. One main point though is that the plaintiff had mentioned that he did not know how to use text message. Although the text message he received proved that his phone was able to receive it\, the phone records did not indicate that he replied to the text message.  \
,50
96,136,P,70,Both parties had some fault. Witnesses state that the driver might have been distracted by his phone. The driver was also speeding. The cyclist was distracted while biking\, holding a call on his phone\, and misjudged what the signal light cycle was on.\
   \
,35
97,138,P,90,The evidence is very clear in that Mr. Woodward was on the phone prior to the collision and that Mr. Johnson received a phone just before the collision that lasted to minute the collision occurred.  It was also stated that Mr. Johnson was speeding at the time of the collision so with him stating that he had just started to accelerate when the collision happened did not make sense to me because the evidence does not concur with his statement.  They are both at fault for various reason of breaking the laws that were enforce at the time of the collision but the brunt of the responsibility is on Mr. Johnson\
,20
98,135,D,80,Mr Woodward entered the crosswalk while it was flashing walk. That is negligence. Although I believe the driver's time's and story is a bit off\, ultimately if the cyclist didn't enter the crosswalk when the walk was flashing nothing would have occurred.\
  \
,70
99,140,P,85,bike + car = cyclist (if alive) winning judicial battle; especially in a crosswalk setting\, driver needs to be competent enough to safeguard not only for himself and fellow drivers on the road\, but for pedestrians and cyclist as well.  \
\
,25
100,139,D,70,Both were at fault for the accident because the the person on the bicycle as talk on the phone with ear buds on and crossed the intersection when not allowed and the driver may have been speeding and/or was on the phone.    \
,50
101,141,P,100,NULL,50
102,143,D,92,The plaintiff entered the intersection when the "Don't Walk" crosswalk sign was flashing. The law clearly states that a cyclist or pedestrian should not enter the intersection when the "Don't Walk" sign is flashing. If the plaintiff had already been in the intersection when the signal started flashing the law states he should have continued through. But the plaintiff stated that the signal was already flashing when he began entering the intersection. The plaintiff also stated that he was wearing earbuds. The law states that you may not operate a bicycle or vehicle if you are wearing headphones or earbuds over both ears. Therefore the plaintiff is at fault for his own injuries. \
   \
,88
103,144,D,88,It seems that Mr. Johnson was using his cellphone while driving. The female witness claimed that she saw him texting. What's interesting is that he claimed that he did not know how to text\, yet the witnessed saw him texting. Even though the plantiff\, Mr. Woodward\, entered the intersection when the crosswalk sign was flashing(when he wasn't supposed to enter)\, the car should have seen him and stopped. He also was wearing headphones\, which is slightly negligent\, but he had the right-of-way.  \
,60
104,146,D,51,I do not believe that either party provided enough evidence to prove the other party's guilt  \
,45
105,142,D,80,From the evidence gathered I believe the Cyclist did not have the full amount of time needed to safely cross the intersection\, and assumed that he had enough time\, therefore putting himself at fault for not completely adhering to the flashing "Don't walk" signal. The motorist was clearly following traffic signals and did not expect to keep still when the light had turned green\, he was simply abiding by the traffic signal.\
\
\
,80
106,145,D,70,By the cyclists own admission he entered the intersection when the hand was flashing. This is clearly negligence on his part. It also seems likely that he was wearing headphones in both ears while on the phone. Both are instances of negligence. The driver of the car was also probably speeding\, may have been looking at a text but not sending one\, but who did have the right of way. Both motorists interviewed seemed to think that the light was green\, both Mr. Johnson and the driver who almost rear-ended him. So\, this seems like it was mostly the cyclist's fault.\
\
,60
107,148,D,100,cyclist firstly should not be focused on a dog or a phone call in a busy intersection. and should know to slow down if a hand is flashing in an intersection because the light can turn green any moment. the defendant seemed distracted also but was crossing intersection when it was his turn to go.  \
\
,80
108,149,D,80,NULL,82
109,147,P,85,The bicyclist did not have the right away to enter the intersection as the many distractions around him caused him to be unaware of his surroundings \
  \
,65
110,152,P,90,The cyclist entered the crosswalk while it was flashing do not enter. It clearly states on the sign post to not enter the intersection when the crosswalk light is flashing. The cyclist was not already in the crosswalk when it began flashing. Although the motorist made every attempt to swerve\, the cyclist still should not have entered the crosswalk. \
,70
111,151,D,15,I felt that someone must have not been telling the complete truth\, but I could not decide for sure.  \
,53
112,159,D,86,He was in the car and the cyclist had already entered the intersection. If he had not been speeding he would of had time to stop. However the cyclist should not have entered the intersection after the flashing orange hand had started.\
,30
113,157,D,100,The biggest thing for me in this case was that Woodward entered the intersection when the hand was flashing. Mr. Johnson has right of way since the light was green. looking at his phone bill proves that he doesn't really text. Mr. Woodward was also on the phone and distracted by a dog and wasn't paying attention. Their just wasn't enough evidence to prove that Mr. Johnson was more at fault. More evidence led me to believe that Mr. Woodward wasn't obeying traffic laws and was distracted and therefore has no grounds too sue. \
\
\
    \
,67
114,160,D,61,The individual on riding the bike admitted to crossing the intersection when it was not permitted to do so.  \
,60
115,154,P,70,I feel like the driver was lying about texting while driving.  the evidence does not back up his claim.  for the cyclist\, i think that even though he should not have gone through the intersection when he did and while being distracted\, i honestly think that the guy must have run the red light with his car and was speeding.\
furthermore i think that if you really wanted to know who did this why dont you use the camera lights that are at intersections in order to determine who was really in the wrong.  \
,40
116,155,P,75,Both the plaintiff and the defendant did act negligent while crossing the intersection\, but the defendant was using his phone either by call or text that were proven in the bills. So i hold him more responsible for the collision.\
   \
,37
117,156,D,75,There were several clear indicators that the cyclist was not paying attention to his surroundings. For one\, he was on a call while on his bike\, which was most likely a bigger distraction to him than he would be willing to admit. He also entered the intersection on a flashing DO NOT WALK sign and continued on anyways. The driver did all that he could to not hit the cyclist but did have the green light\, while the cyclist had been warned by the flashing signal that he should not enter the crosswalk.  \
,60
118,158,P,71,I think the bicyclist had less of the fault to this collusion because the car could have seen the bicyclist crossing the road . Most of the time bicyclist do not have time to get through a light because theirs pedestrians walking or cars turning and that's how an accident can happen.     \
,37
119,161,P,0,Like my mummy always told me\, you should look both ways before crossing the street. The cyclist was being a dippie\, and should always do that. Just because I know that it is illegal to stab someone\, that doesn't mean that I am going to let my guard down when there is a psychopath standing right in front of me. with a knife.\
\
,49
120,162,P,75,  \
If the driver wouldn't have been speeding he would have had time to slow down before hitting the cyclist\, especially if he would of not been distracted with his mobile device.,40
121,164,D,86,I believe Mr. Woodrow is mostly responsible for the accident because at the time he was using both headphones in his ears as well as crossing the intersection when he clearly was not supposed to be. \
  \
,72
122,163,P,75,motorist was distracted by previous missed call / text and was speeding through the intersection before coming to a full stop after red light turned into green. failed to look both ways as he crossed through intersection resulting in collision with cyclist. cyclist should not have entered the intersection when he saw blinking cross signal which contributed to his accident but the motorist was mostly to blame due to his lack of attention to the road as well as his own speed (elongated tire marks at the scene of accident).\
\
,30
123,165,D,80,  \
Mr. Johnson abides to the traffic light. The light turned green so it has his right of way when crossing the intersection. Mr. Woolworth assumed safe passage even when the signal said "Do Not Cross". But the cyclist is a pedestrian\, and he has the right of way even in an accident like this. Johnson was driving at excessive speed to continue in the green light\, but the cyclist was though he could make it as well.  ,53
124,167,D,36,The cyclist admits to being on the phone during the time of the collision. The evidence shows that he was on the phone\, also he did have at least one ear bud in at the time of the crash. The motorist had two phone calls only a few minutes apart\, however both lasting less than 5 minutes. He also received one text message\, however there is no evidence that he responded. Although\, one of the witnesses had said that she saw the plaintiff texting there is no evidence to support that. We do know that the cyclist was on the phone at the time and most likely the more distracted one during the time of the crash.   \
,56
125,170,D,80, i decided to find Mr Johnson guilty of the case because i feel like as motorists we are responsible to provide more safety to the pedestrians around us. in addition\, as motorists we can make more damage to someone in regards to physical and permanent damage. We are also able to stop faster because we are driving a vehicle. that is why i believe that the pedestrians should always have the right of way. ,28
126,166,D,70,Both the plaintiff and the defendant were both partially at fault for the accident\, but the plaintiff was\, in my eyes\, more at fault for the accident. The plaintiff was on a phone call until promptly after the accident (meaning the phone probably hung up right as the collision occurred) and the defendant was\, according to one witness\, looking down at his phone promptly before the collision. Being on the phone in general is a highly distracting activity\, therefore the plaintiff was equally to blame for the phone usage. However\, the plaintiff attempted to enter the intersection and was not already in the intersection when the crosswalk signal was blinking\, therefore he should have slowed to a stop instead of trying to "beat the light". The defendant noticed other cars stopped and probably assumed the light was going to turn green\, therefore he slowed down only a little bit\, but still slowed nonetheless\, in anticipation of the light turning green. The defendant was following the law whereas the cyclist actually was violating the law by attempting to enter the intersection when the crosswalk signal had already been flashing.\
,65
127,168,D,74,It seems that the cyclist was distracted at the time of the collision.  Although\, Mr. Johnson did not completely stop at the intersection it seems that the light was green and he entered at the same time as the cyclist. \
,66
128,169,P,90,Being both an experienced driver and cyclist\, i believe that the motorist was negligent because he was driving too fast while entering an intersection with some blind areas\, a driver must always be cautious of areas that he/she cannot see. i believe the cyclist was also at fault because he too negligently entered the intersection without making sure that it was clear beforehand\, as well as it being stated not to enter when the signal is flashing\, which he did. \
,40
129,171,D,80,According to cyclist's statement to responding officer\, cyclist entered intersection while crosswalk flashed to indicate not to enter.\
\
It is not certain how the light changed in relation to the motorist entering the intersection. The following motorist who witnessed the accident reports almost rear-ending the motorist\, which is strong evidence that he entered the intersection lawfully. It is not certain whether the motorist could have avoided the cyclist or if his speeding contributed to the accident. It is certain the driver was not talking on the phone during the accident\, and evidence strongly suggests he was not texting.\
\
The evidence is not strong enough to prove negligence on the part of the motorist\, while there is evidence of some negligence on the part of the cyclist.,90
130,174,P,60, The reason I found Mr. Johnson to be at fault was because it was found that he was on his phone exactly one minute before the incident. While Mr. Woodward was using his phone as well\, I feel that it is up to the motorist to be more cautious\, as they have a greater potential of harming someone else. \
\
\
  \
,35
131,172,D,83,Mr. Woodward entered the intersection while the do not walk sign was flashing and the signal description say that when the do not walk sign is flashing it means do not enter the cross walk and if you were already in the cross walk finish crossing. If Mr. Woodward had followed this rule\, the collision would not have occurred.  \
,70
132,176,P,85,I believe that if the cyclist was paying more attention to what he was doing rather than his conference call he would have been able to read the signs on the pole by the cross walk stating that if you have not entered the cross walk when it the red is already flashing then you should not begin. The motorist was following all traffic laws in regards to the lights and timing of the collision. If a light is green that means go. Everyone should be watching out for themselves and paying attention to their own surroundings.   \
,56
133,175,D,70,Just because driver has more responsibility than cyclist's one. This is because smaller is weaker\, and bigger is stronger. The driver never die when he hits the cyclist\, but the cyclist would have been dead if the driver had hit the cyclist much stronger. \
,80
134,173,D,35,I do beleive both are to blame. Both neglected to obey the laws that were put into place for the particular reason that they experienced.   \
,51
135,177,D,80,The traffic Signal indicated that the biker should not have started to cross the intersection after the signal appeared.\
  \
,55
136,180,D,80,The cyclist started to accelerate through the intersection as the crosswalk light was flashing (He should have never started that late) as well as on the phone/distracted. The motorist was just looking after speed signs.\
,70
137,179,D,40,The reason why I believe the responsibility should be 50/50 is because both bicyclists and motor vehicles shares the road together and should each be responsible for following the rules individually,50
138,178,D,90,The cyclist entered the intersection with a blinking "do not walk" sign\, warning him to not enter the intersection. He also was on the cell phone with both ear plugs in. The cyclist did not give his full attention to motorist approaching the intersection at the time of the accident. The driver was not on the phone at the time of the accident and was not drinking. Mr. Woodward is guilty for riding his bicycle into the intersection without paying close attention to the traffic.    \
,70
139,182,P,53,pedestrians have the right of way.\
  \
,49
140,185,P,90,The biker should have never taken a phone call while riding on the bike. Also he should have not enter the cross walk when the walk sign is flashing. \

141,184,P,71,In my opinion\, the driver should take reponsible to this accidence,40
142,183,D,93,it was not the drivers fault the biker should not have entered the intersection if the hand was flashing.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
  \
,82
143,186,P,70,I think that Mr. Woodward is most responsible because he entered the intersection when he was not supposed to with multiple distractions at the same time. Him being on the phone and seeing the dog at the same time\, hindered his ability to decide whether he should enter intersection or not\, even though he was not supposed to anyways. Had he not been so detracted he might have been able to make a better decision based on the situation. although Mr. Johnson was traveling faster than he should have\, he still entered the intersection while it was green like he should have and just did not see the biker who entered the intersection when he was not supposed to. \
,66
144,187,D,100,  the cyclist entered an intersection after a solid no walk light was flashing\, the driver had a green light and therefore had right of way in the intersection where the collision occurred.  ,100
145,190,D,80,Woodward said he entered the intersection when the signal was flashing which means do not enter.  There is proof that The defendant does not text.  Woodward was on the phone and could have been distracted since he did not really see the vehicle until it was too late and didn't try to swerve. The driver did brake and swerve so he was paying attention\, he was just going too fast to stop. His speeding would have been less of an issue if Woodward had not entered the intersection after the hand was flashing telling him to not enter the intersection.  \
    \
,100
146,191,D,70,I think car driver and cyclist should be follow the rule. Also\, both of them have their  responsibility to keep their rule.    \
,50
147,194,P,85,Both parties seem to have been at fault but more so on the motorist side because he appears to have been lying about his ability for text messaging and using his phone for phone calls. \
  \
,40
148,189,D,85,It is evident that the cyclist entered the intersection when the driver had a green light. I think that the cyclist may have seen the do not cross sign flashing\, but it could have been the very last flash\, which either way still indicates a do not go. The driver had a green light so he crossed the intersection. The speed limit is 45 mph so there would not have been enough time to stop for the cyclist. It is possible for the driver to have been reading a text message but that is irrelevant due to him having a green light. The cyclist broke many laws including having both ear phones in talking on the phone and crossing when the "do not walk" was flashing.\
,80
149,195,D,75,Each party is at fault\, but Mr. Woodward is more at fault because he failed to use precautionary measures on while riding his bicycle into the intersection during a flashing light.   \
,60
150,193,D,90,The Cyclist was trying to beat the light and only focused on the flashing don't walk sign. Furthermore as stated in the plaintiff's statement he stated that he saw a truck slow down. This means that the light must have been turning yellow and he should have stopped and not try to beat the light.\
,65
151,196,D,100,  Mr. Woodward should not have entered the intersection knowing that the crosswalk sign was flashing the "don't walk" signal. He should have stopped in time. Mr. Johnson acted accordingly to the accident and he did not intend to hit the cyclist. Mr. Johnson's actions were not negligent in my opinion. The cyclist just seems like he does not want the blame to be put on him. Also\, the witness in the SUV who stated that she thinks she saw Mr. Johnson texting at the time of the accident is not a very reliable source. His records shows that he was not sending a text at that time. He received a text earlier but it did not show that he sent one back. The cyclist could have been distracted by his call and the sight of the dog in the SUV\, which could have caused the accident. Mr. Johnson should not be at fault and the cyclist should be at fault for the accident. The police officer should not have even justified that Mr. Johnson was speeding because he did not have a forensic person deem that true. He just used his own opinion on the matter. ,60
152,188,D,90,Although I think it was both of their faults\, I do think Mr. Woodward was slightly more at fault since he was both distracted and entered the crosswalk when the hand was flashing (an illegal act).  And even though Mr. Johnson was (most likely) texting while driving\, there was not sufficient proof to show this. I don't know why they didn't do the math to see who had the red light since it sounds like a simple equation\, and they should have asked to see in Mr. Johnson's phone then if he had an outgoing text that would be more evidence to show he was at fault.\
,55
153,192,D,40,Do to the bicyclist trying to ride into the intersection when the lights where flashing shows and also talking on the phone being distracted he was not able to take care of himself in the intersection. But the driver is also responsible because he was on probably texting and speeding.,60
154,204,P,75,The defendant said he did not know how to text yet one of the witnesses said she saw him texting while driving. This makes the defendants testimony unreliable. Furthermore\, the police office believes that the defendant was speeding when the collision occurred\, which shows recklessness on the motorists part. The cyclist could have been more careful\, since he was distracted by a dog\, however most of the blame should be on the motorist.  \
,20
155,198,P,70,they're both at fault\, however motorist must be more cautious of pedestrians and cyclist as the vehicle greatly has more power and harm when in contact\, however cyclist must be aware of oncoming traffic and aware when to cross and whether it is clear to cross even if its the crosswalk is flashing okay to walk\
  \
,40
156,201,P,85,I feel that there was more evidence proving the defendant was at fault.\
  \
,30
157,197,P,85,Both parties are at fault for not stopping. Although\, Johnson was texting/talking on the phone while speeding. Making him slightly more at fault.  \
,30
158,200,D,75,It was never proven that the motorist was on his phone during the time of the collision\, nor was it ever proven that he was going over the speed limit at this time. The cyclist\, however\, had ear buds in\, although it is illegal\, and he started going into the cross walk when the hand was flashing\, which you are not supposed to do unless you started walking before the hand began flashing.  \
,75
159,202,P,80,Woodward admitted he was talking on the phone in his statement\, but Johnson lied about texting. Both texting and talking on the phone are illegal and dangerous so both should be at fault. I think Johnson is more at fault because he lied and because he was also speeding. \
,40
160,203,D,70,if plantiff  had check the signal lights to cross and as always look both ways\, to see oncoming traffic\, he know if it was safe to cross the intersection or not\
\
,60
161,199,D,100,The cyclist shouldn't have been talking on the phone with his headphones on. Because he was talking on the phone he was not aware of what was around him. If he was not talking on the phone he probably could have heard the car coming and could have prevented the accident. He also should not have crossed when the hand was flashing because he was not even on the crosswalk yet which meant he had to wait until it was his turn to walk again.  \
\
,100
162,213,D,70,I think that Mr. Johnson is innocent in this case because it is evident that he was abiding by the rules of the road. Mr. Woodward on the other hand was not doing everything in his power tor remain safe. Though Mr. Johnson may have been going too fast\, it isn't supported that that is the reason that Mr. Woodward was struck.   \
,80
163,210,D,50,  \
I believe they were both at fault. They are both 50% responsible. \
,50
164,209,D,77,If the flashing hand was on it means that the biker should not enter the intersection. When the biker entered the intersection i believe the drive did have a green light and it was the bikers fault. The biker was on his phone and was also distracted by looking at the dog and not in front of him. The driver probably does use his phone when he drive but the biker said he was on the phone for a conference call at 11-46 for 15 min the means the driver had to be on his phone at 12-01 which he was not. \
 \
\
,90
165,212,P,70,  The defendant appears to have been distracted on his phone.\
,30
166,205,D,94,i believe that more of the fault is on the cyclist\, Mr. Woodward\, who was on a conference call with a client at the time of the accident. It clearly states that when the hand signal is flashing that no one should enter the intersection anymore. Mr. Woodward saw the hand flashing and thought he would have enough time to beat the light. He was wrong. He made it only about half way through the intersection when the motorist\, Mr. Johnson hit him. Although Mr.Johnson did not fully stop\, it was not his fault\, because he slowed down and then sped back up when he saw that the light was green. \
